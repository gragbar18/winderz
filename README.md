# Winderz

> **Android developement project for windsport lovers**

The application allows users to register all their session whether they do kitesurf, windsurf, surf or any other sea and wind related activities.
When a new session is registered, you can put various informations like the spot, the wind speed, the size of the wave, time spent on the water, describe your session to be able to relate to it in a few months and see how you are progressing.

The second feature is to be able to register spots on a private and a public map, allowing users to share if they want, tips about some places.
